The NINT was a scrapped peripheral of the Nintendo 64. Its full name was the Nintendo Interactive. The add-on is similarly designed to that of the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive, connecting to the console from the bottom. The NINT supposedly had a sort of internet connection, being able to record the weather, and add new features to other N64 games, giving them day/night cycles. The implementation of this is only complete for Super Mario 64, however. This causes anomalies such as the Internal Clock or Internal Weather System. Only 3 prototypes were made, according to a leaked internal document from Argonaut, the company that worked on the console and peripheral at the time.The NINT tried to make the Nintendo 64 more like one of their later consoles, the Nintendo Wii. However, the features were relegated to a more primitive menu, reminiscent of the Nintendo GameCube's. It could tell the time, track the weather, albeit how it does this is unknown, and mark dates. It also had Satellaview-esque features, being able to play demos off of a connection. The only demo that came out for the NINT was an early test of Super Mario 64, considering it never shipped worldwide. It was deemed too expensive to mass produce and shelved. This is Project X.S a NX2 Revival of the NINT on all platfrms from atari-ps5. [C] @Flames Co. 20XX
